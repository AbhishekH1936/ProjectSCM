The security deposit shall be used when the sales on the crop return losses. Farmers can request a maximum of 50\% of the security deposit they have invested in the application for their crops as public funds across all crops, which most likely increases their productivity by 33\%. Farmers can increase or decrease the security deposit on their account, based on the number of active fundings on the crops yet to be sold and have availed for funding.
